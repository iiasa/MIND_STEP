## MIND STEP toolbox at IIASA

This site provides guidance on access and use of MIND STEP infrastructure hosted at IIASA.

### Subversion repositories

A Subversion repository can be obtained for hosting MIND-STEP-related code and data. Repositories can be accessed with a Subversion client (e.g. TortoiseSVN) or from a CI server via a URL of the form https://svnesm.iiasa.ac.at/svn/myrepo where 'myrepo' is the name of the repository you obtained. To obtain a repository, email [[]] and suggest a name. Your request will be verified and forwarded to the IIASA ICT department who will contact you by email with the credentials (username and password).
